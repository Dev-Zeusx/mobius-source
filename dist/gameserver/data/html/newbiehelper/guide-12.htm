*A novice character* is one who is new to the world ofLineage II. Certain benefits are available to novice characters up to level 62. Taxes and other charges have led to a steep increase in prices for armor and weaponry. To help offset this problem, *novice characters can exchange their used gear for full credit towards the purchase of new equipment* inany weapon or armor shop.Also, the threat of monsters may be overwhelming fornovice characters. I help them as much as possible.. *Come and see me for support magic that is appropriate for your level.* This will help build the confidence you'll need to challenge the powerful monsters in this world.
